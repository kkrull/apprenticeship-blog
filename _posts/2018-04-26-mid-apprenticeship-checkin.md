It's hard to believe with time seeming to pass by so quickly, but I am already half way through a 3 month apprenticeship at 8th Light.  The life of an apprentice can be quite busy, so I thought it would be worthwhile to pause, reflect, and remember for a moment.

When I stop the flurry of activity long enough to think about it, this is a pretty awesome experience.

Let me explain why.


### Team Culture

The first thing that struck me when I walked in the door is how positive everyone is.  Folks involved in on-boarding show a genuine interest helping me to get to know my new colleagues, and there are multiple apprentices like me who are all having similar work assignments and experiences.  We get opportunities to pair with each other and with other Crafters, and there are mentors and checkpoints in the program to see that my learning and development is on-track.

Compare that to some peoples' experiences in large organizations, where you're given a story to work on and left to learn the domain, codebase, and what the team values by yourself.  It's sad but sometimes true: Companies can spend a lot of effort to find, interview and hire somebody, and then all but forget about that person once they arrive.  I've seen people arrive for day 1 and leave the company a few days later.  Other people start with a lot of enthusiasm but don't receive adequate support, and that precious energy for positive change is lost.

Finally, there are two, vital words I've heard early and often here.  These are words that I have only heard rarely in my career up until now: ***good job***.


### Learning

Another value which I appreciate is a universal enthusiasm for learning.  It's not hard to find people who are interested in learning enough of the latest buzzword to be able to claim experience in it.  But that approach often lacks depth and leads — in my opinion — to situations where new technologies continually get mis-applied to a system of ever-increasing, needless complexity.  The culture surrounding this behavior often results in a popular in–group that keeps embracing (and discarding) the latest technology, and the rest of us who just want to understand what the users need and make a working product for them.

At the other extreme, I have seen teams that fall in love with some really popular development stack and never seem to feel comfortable trying anything new.  While their chosen stack can often be a good choice, it smacks a bit of the Golden Hammer anti-pattern.

Here, I often hear the phrase "I haven't learned ___, yet," where the blank can be filled in by a language, programming paradigm, or something related to software development, but not to writing code.  The key ingredients in this sentence are:

- What is to be learned is not always a flavor of the month buzzword:  It's often something more general like "functional programming".
- The use of the word "yet": There's every intention and expectation to be learning this.  Learning is just a matter of time.
- The use of the word "I": The expectation is on the speaker to do the learning.  Nobody's sitting on their hands waiting for their boss to take an interest in them.


### Waza

Waza – or 10% time — is something I have dreamed of doing, but never really had access to before.  Ironically, I have been in many situations where I thought: "I know I can try library X, tool Y, or technique Z to fix the problem I'm in, but the deadline is too close to learn that right now."  You'd think that more organizations would make the association between teams digging themselves into a hole and the lack of time spent learning about their craft and what's available.

I do get what I expected out of my Waza time — a chance to learn something for a few hours that's interesting, and some familiarity and comfort with something new.  It also has a benefit I did not foresee: After a long week of working really hard on my work assignments, the Waza time helps me re-connect with the simple joy of doing what I do.  It forces me to pull myself away from the near-term focus of getting the next feature done, to remember why it is I do what I do as a craft.

The only challenge here is to figure out what best to do on any given Friday afternoon, but that's a good problem to have.  It's also good practice in breaking up larger ideas into bite-sized tasks with tangible goals.


## What's next?

What's in store for the rest of my apprenticeship?  I don't know all the details, but I can remind myself to do one thing: *enjoy it*.
