## TDD Philosophy

Goal: Bring some order to a polarized topic with some objective discussion about the benefits and gaps in TDD.

### What have I learned since my recent writings?

* Other techniques exist, and where to look for them.
* Doing some things bottom-up is fine.  TDD doesn't mean you have to do top-down design
* TDD doesn't mean you have to try to drive to a novel algorithm and wait for something to emerge.
  Well-known algorithms can be test driven just like anything else.  Maybe it's not unlike doing an earlier prototype
  and that prototype holding up when you go and re-implement it with TDD.

**To be interesting, I would have to say more about how to use those other techniques**  That's a lot of research.


### Am I saying anything original?

Probably not.  There's a lot of writing on this topic, and I would have to spend some time researching if anyone
else has been talking about this stuff.


### Does this put me at odds with the community?

It's such a polarized topic that it's bound to attract some negative attention from detractors.
