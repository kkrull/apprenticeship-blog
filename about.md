This is a blog about software development.  I'm your host, Kyle Krull, Resident Apprentice at [8th Light][employer].

I've been writing software professionally since 2004.  I've worked in a number of areas over the years, from simulations
of human behavior, to Molecular Diagnostics, to regular web applications.  Aside from traditional development of backend
services in Java, I've worked professionally doing functional programming in Scheme and web development in Ruby on Rails
and React.js.

In terms of philosophy, I make an effort to understand how each language, library, and technique can be useful.  In my
opinion - there's usually something worth learning from both sides of the great debates in our field (such as functional
and Object Oriented styles, for example).  I find it's a lot more fulfilling to understand the merits of something new,
before dismissing it as something merely fashionable or misguided.
